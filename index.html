    <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>Whether you are in individual, business, or non-profit, you have an identity and a message for the world. Helping you discover this is one my favorite parts of my job.</p>
        <h3>CMS</h3>
            <p>Don’t worry, you won’t get nickled and dimed when you need to update content. You’ll be equipped with a Content Management System to update all that yourself.</p>
        <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I craft clean, vibrant, responsive designs that are visually appealing, interactive, with practical functions.</p>
        <h3>Analytics</h3>

        <h3>Tech Talk</h3>
            <p>I am proficient in HTML5 and CSS3 and familiar with Javascript, JQuery, SCSS, Wordpress and Ruby on Rails.<p>
        <h3>Classical Music</h3>
            <p>My extensive background in classical music gives me a unique edge as a web developer. I see each project as a kind of digital composition.</p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>

    <div>
        <h1>My Pricing</h1>
            <p>The most common first question I get is, "How much do you charge?" This is an understandable first question, but doesn't tackle the most important questions to ask of your web developer. Let's put things into focus.
                <h3>Trust</h3>
                    <p>You should never hire someone you don’t trust. I will always be transparent about hours and cost of your project. I’m incurably honest.</p>
                <h3>Partnership</h3>
                    <p>Every decision your web developer makes will impact your business. When you hire me, you aren't just hiring an hourly worker. I am committed to the long-term success of your organization.</p>
                <h3>Competancy</h3>
                    <p>I have the resources and abilities to deliver the high quality work.</p>
                <h3>Connections</h3>
                    <p>I may work freelance, but I’m no lone ranger. I collaborate closely with a team of developers all over the country.</p>

        <h2>A Tale of Two Pricing Systems</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Fixed Bid</h3>
                <p>Everyone wants to know how much a website will cost. But a fixed bid estimate does a poor job of representing the natural variation of a task and the time required for it.</p>
            </h3>Time and Materials</h3>
                <p>Instead, I do a time & materials estimate - a fixed hourly rate applied to a good faith estimate of the range of time required to complete each component of the website. That way, the overall cost of the project is ultimately within your control. First estimate too expensive? No problem. We can trim the scope of the project to fit within your budget.<p>
